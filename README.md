# Tearâ™ª's Touhou Mods

Central location for my modifications to various Touhou games, running on the [thcrap patch engine](https://thpatch.net/wiki/Touhou_Patch_Center).

## alphes-alt
A mod that replaces ZUN's character art with [kaoru](https://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=743845)'s [redrawn versions](http://gensoukyou.1000.tv/dl.html). **Currently supports TH16**. Other games might be [impossible](https://github.com/Gamer251/thcrap-gamer251/commit/37458b186065d403a3e06537984337aee7279f64) to support at this moment without some extensions to thcrap's image patching mechanism, but if/when it does happen, this mod will be an alternative to DTM's [dairi art patch](https://github.com/DTM9025/DTM/tree/master/alphes). Obviously, neither artist is objectively better, so at that point I will recommend checking out both patches and choosing one for each game based on personal preference.

* **TH16** - Initial. Please point out any glaring misalignments. Also please share ideas for the main menu screen.
